# #Write a program that can be used by a small theater to sell tickets for performances. The
# theaterâ€™s auditorium has 15 rows of seats with 30 seats in each row. The program should display
# a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. Seats thar are available are
# represented by # and seats that are taken are represent by a *.
# There are aisles after seats H and V.
